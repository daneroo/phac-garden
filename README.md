# phac-garden

This is a monorepo for the PHAC Garden project.
I gather my experiments here, and try to document the process as I go.

As it is a monorepo it will contain many different projects.

- Serverless functions (deployed to CLoud Run)
- Static Sites (deployed to Cloud Run)
- Next.js site(s) (deployed to Cloud Run, and perhaps Vercel)

## Monorepo orchestration

To manage the different projects inside a single git repository we will be using [Nx](https://nx.dev/).

As Nx is based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) we have chosen [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager.

## Infra and CI/CD

We will use a combination of GitHub Actions, GCP `gcloud` command and GCP Cloud Build.
