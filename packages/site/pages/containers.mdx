# Containers

This repository already contains a few simple services we can use to build.

Each of them will be packaged into a container and run locally.

## Pre-requisites

This part of the guide can be run from GitHub Codespaces or locally (if you have docker installed).

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";
import Image from "next/image";

<Tabs items={["Locally", "CodeSpaces"]}>
  <Tab>
    <p>
      To run this locally, you will need to have
      [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/") installed. You will also
      need the git commands.
    </p>
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    You can navigate to [this project on
    GitHub](https://github.com/daneroo/phac-garden) and click the "Code" button
    and then "Create codespace on main" button to open it in GitHub Codespaces.
    <Image
      src="/images/open-codespaces.png"
      alt="Open GitHub CodeSpaces"
      width={494}
      height={539}
    />

    That should open a web page with a running VSCode in your browser. You can
    then open a terminal and run the commands below.


    <Image
      src="/images/codespaces-terminal.png"
      alt="Open GitHub CodeSpaces"
      width={640}
      height={422}
    />

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Confirmation

```bash
$ git --version
git version 2.40.0

docker --version

 Cloud integration: v1.0.31
