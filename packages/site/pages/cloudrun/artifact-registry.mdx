# Create an Artifact Registry

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

We will now create a repository for our docker images (OCI Images) in Artifact Registry.
This will allow us to store our images in a private registry.
We will use this registry to store our images for Cloud Run and later GKE.

```bash
# so we can execute gcloud commands
gcloud auth login


# project name is phx-danl
export PROJECT_ID="pdcp-cloud-009-danl"
# Get the PROJECT_NUMBER from the PROJECT_ID
export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} --format="value(projectNumber)")
export REGION="northamerica-northeast1"
export REPO_NAME="garden-repo"

gcloud config set project ${PROJECT_ID}

# Create an artifact registry repository
gcloud artifacts repositories create ${REPO_NAME} \
   --repository-format=docker \
   --location=${REGION} \
   --description="${REPO_NAME}"

# Allow our service account to read from the registry
gcloud artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding ${REPO_NAME} \
    --location=${REGION} \
    --member=serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role="roles/artifactregistry.reader"
```

Confirm the repository was created:

```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories describe  ${REPO_NAME} --location ${REGION}
```

Should yeild output similar to:

```bash
Encryption: Google-managed key
Repository Size: 0.000MB
createTime: '2023-04-17T17:01:06.020281Z'
description: garden-repo
dockerConfig: {}
format: DOCKER
mode: STANDARD_REPOSITORY
name: projects/pdcp-cloud-009-danl/locations/northamerica-northeast1/repositories/garden-repo
updateTime: '2023-04-17T17:01:06.020281Z'
```

Now allow our docker client to read/write from the registry (for later)

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker ${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev
```
