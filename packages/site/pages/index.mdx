    This is a place where we can share our knowledge and learn from each other.
    We hope you enjoy your stay!

    Feel free to [wander off the path](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken) but this is one way through the garden.

<Steps >

### Step 1 - Containers

You will learn what a docker container is, how to build one and how to run it.

### Step 2 - Minumum Viable Cloud

Building on Step 1, you will learn how to deploy your container to the cloud.

For minimal friction, we will use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Cloud Run.

### Step 3 - Automating the Steps

Here we will learn how to automate the steps we have taken so far.

So that every time we push to our repository, our container is built and deployed to the cloud.

This will be done using Google Cloud Build

### Step 4 - More to Come

We would love to include the following topics:

- Building stateful containers (databases, caches, etc.)
- Provisioning to Kubernetes (GKE)
- Sharing Data
  - What is an API?
  - What is Grapql?
- Security and Zero Trust in Praactice
- ...
