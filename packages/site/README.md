- [x] Using Nextra <https://nextra.site/>
- [ ] Using Tailwind with Next.js <https://blog.nrwl.io/setup-next-js-to-use-tailwind-with-nx-849b7e21d8d0>

## Local Development

First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.

## Adding tailwind

```bash
... TODO
```

## Initial Setup

I cloned: <https://github.com/shuding/nextra-docs-template>

Another option would have been: <https://github.com/jaredpalmer/nextra-blank-custom-theme>, which has tailwind already setup

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
